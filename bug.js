function calculateTotal(items) {let total = 0; for (let i = 0; i < items.length; i++) { total += items[i].price; } return total;}This function calculates the total price of items in an array. However, if the array is empty or contains items with invalid price values (e.g., non-numeric values), it may lead to unexpected results or errors. For instance, if items is an empty array, it will return 0, which might be the expected behavior. However, if items contains an item with a price of 'abc', it will throw a TypeError because you can't add a string to a number.  Another potential issue is that it modifies the original array because of using splice.
